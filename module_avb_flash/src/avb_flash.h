 * written in this call.
 *
 * This function may take some time to complete - it will wait for data to
 * be written, and it may have to erase a sector of data. The time taken
 * depends mostly on flash speed, but may well be tens of milliseconds when
 * a sector needs to be erased. A write operation may take a few hundred
 * microseconds, and if spiFlashPersistentStateRead() has not been called
 * then a full search of flash may be necessary.
 *
 * Many calls to this function will wear out the flash memory. A flash
 * memory may wear out after as little as 100,000 cycles, so if this
 * function is called every 200 us, and the segment is 8192 bytes for
 * 15-bytes of data, then the memory will wear out in (8192/(15+1)) *
 * 100,000 * 0.0002 seconds, which is about 3 hours. Calls to this function
 * should therefore be limited (for example to at most once every few
 * seconds), or the persistent segment should be made much larger.
 *
 * Note that there are hypothetical cases where valid data may be found if
 * the erase function is interrupted by a power failure. A CRC check shall
 * be performed on the data if this is an issue for the application.
 *
 * \param data array in which the persistent data to be written is stored.
