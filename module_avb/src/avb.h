/** Initialize the AVB control thread.
 * 
 *  This function initializes the AVB system. It needs to be called in
 *  the main user control thread before any other AVB control call.
 *  The function takes chanends connected to other parts of the system and
 *  registers all of these components. 
 *
 *  At this point the sinks, sources and media FIFOs are allocated numbers. 
 *  The allocation
 *  is performed by registering numbers from 0 upwards working through the
 *  listener_ctl/talker_ctl/media_ctl arrays. 
 *  Each component in this array may register
 *  several sink/sources/FIFOs. For example, if the listener_ctl array connects
 *  to two listener units each registering 3 sinks then the first unit will 
 *  be allocated sink numbers 0,1,2 and the second 3,4,5.
 *
 *  Note that this call does not start any protocols communicating over the 
 *  network (e.g. advertising talkers via IEEE 802.1Qat). That is deferred 
 *  until the call to avb_start().
 *
 *  \param media_ctl    array of chanends connected to components that
 *                      register/control media FIFOs
 *  \param listener_ctl array of chanends connected to components 
 *                      that register/control IEEE 1722 sinks
 *  \param talker_ctl   array of chanends connected to components that
 *                      register/control IEEE 1722 sources
